# Rock vs Mine

This project aims to differentiate between rocks and mines for submarines navigating in the ocean.

The dataset is taken from kaggle and is uploaded in this repository for practice purposes.

Since we have only 2 discrete options, this problem will be categorized as classification (either rock or mine).

The machine learning models used are: 
- Logistic Regression
- SVC (Support vector classifier)
